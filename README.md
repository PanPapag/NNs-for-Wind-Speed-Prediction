# NNs-for-Wind-Speed-Prediction
The aim of this project is to perform experimental valuation using a pretrained deep neural network for wind speed prediction. The aforementioned experiments include:
1. Comparisons of NN results with actual data
2. Î•xport of vector representations of the input of the neural network from intermediate layers
3. Clusterging these vectors using Manhattan metric (L1)
